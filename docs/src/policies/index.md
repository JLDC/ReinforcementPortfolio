# Policies

Policies can be generally thought of as a set of investment rules which govern the behavior of an agent. Policies can range from very simple policies, such as a [`BuyAndHold`](@ref ReinforcementPortfolio.BuyAndHold) to highly complex policies such as the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies](@ref).

Policies belong to the abstract supertype [`AbstractPolicy`](@ref ReinforcementLearning.AbstractPolicy) from the [ReinforcementLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl) package.
